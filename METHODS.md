# Methods
### Raw data collection
The following species were chosen for the promoter analysis: *Homo sapiens* (29598 promoters), *Drosophila melanogaster* (16972 promoters), *Caenorhabditis elegans* (7120 promoters), *Plasmodium 
falciparum* (5597 promoters), *Arabidopsis thaliana* (22703 promoters), and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (5117 promoters).

The promoter sequences are downloaded from the {Eukaryotic Promoter 
Database (EPD)}(https://epd.expasy.org/epd/). The selection was restricted 
to the EPDnew IDs. The sequence of each promoter includes -2000 base pairs 
upstream and 2000 base pairs downstream of a reported TSS. 

###
I generate controls for the statistical analysis by shuffling all DNA sequences available.
