# Methods
### Raw data collection
The following species are chosen for the promoter analysis: *Homo sapiens* (29598 promoters), *Drosophila melanogaster* (16972 promoters), *Caenorhabditis elegans* (7120 promoters), *Plasmodium 
falciparum* (5597 promoters), *Arabidopsis thaliana* (22703 promoters), and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (5117 promoters).

The promoter sequences are downloaded from the [Eukaryotic Promoter 
Database (EPD)](https://epd.expasy.org/epd/). The selection was restricted 
to the EPDnew IDs. The sequence of each promoter includes -2000 base pairs 
upstream and 2000 base pairs downstream of a reported TSS. 

### Controls
Controls for statistical analysis are generated by shuffling all DNA sequences available.

### Promoter shape prediciton
The shape of a DNA is predicted using the [deepDNAshape package](https://github.com/JinsenLi/deepDNAshape/blob/main/README.md) with the following command:

``` bash
deepDNAshape <physical_property> file.fasta
```
The following physical properties are predicted:
- MGW (minor groove width)
- Shear
- Stretch
- Stagger
- Buckle
- ProT
- Opening
- Shift
- Slide
- Rise
- Tilt
- Roll
- HelT
